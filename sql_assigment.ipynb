    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:A database is a collection of data that is organized and structured in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information. Databases are commonly used in various applications such as e-commerce, healthcare, finance, and social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two types of database management systems (DBMS) that differ in their data models, schema, and querying methods.\n",
    "SQL databases use a relational data model with a predefined schema, while NoSQL databases use a non-relational data model with a flexible schema. SQL databases provide strong data consistency and a standardized querying language, while NoSQL databases offer high scalability and performance for handling large volumes of unstructured data. The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases often depends on the specific needs of the application, such as the type of data being stored, the desired level of data consistency, and the expected usage patterns."

    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "Ans:DDL stands for Data Definition Language, and it is a set of SQL statements used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some examples of common DDL statements and their uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create a new database object, such as a table or view. For example, the following statement creates a new table named \"employees\" with three columns: id, name, and salary.\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    salary DECIMAL(10,2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "2.DROP: The DROP statement is used to delete an existing database object, such as a table or view. For example, the following statement drops the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "            DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "3.ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as a table or column. For example, the following statement adds a new column named \"department\" to the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "4.TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to delete all data from a table, but not the table itself. For example, the following statement deletes all data from the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "        TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",

    "Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, and it is a set of SQL statements used to manipulate data in a database. DML statements are used to insert, update, and delete data in tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some examples of common DML statements and their uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.INSERT: The INSERT statement is used to add new data to a table. For example, the following statement inserts a new row into the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "    INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'John Smith', 50000);\n",
    "2.UPDATE: The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table. For example, the following statement updates the salary of the employee with id=1:\n",
    "     UPDATE employees\n",
    "         SET salary = 55000\n",
    "            WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "3.DELETE: The DELETE statement is used to remove data from a table. For example, the following statement deletes the employee with id=1:\n",
    "    DELETE FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE id = 1;\n"

    "Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:DQL stands for Data Query Language, and it is a set of SQL statements used to retrieve data from a database. DQL statements are used to query and retrieve data from tables.\n",

    "The following is an example of a common DQL statement and its use:\n",

    "SELECT * FROM employees;\n",
    "       DQL statements are used to retrieve data from a database, and the most common DQL statement is the SELECT statement. The SELECT statement is used to specify the columns to be retrieved from a table, and it can include WHERE clauses to filter the data based on specific conditions."

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:In a relational database, a primary key and a foreign key are two types of constraints that are used to establish relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. The primary key must be unique and cannot have any null values. In addition, a table can have only one primary key. Primary keys are used to enforce data integrity and ensure that each row in a table can be uniquely identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. The foreign key establishes a link between the two tables and is used to enforce referential integrity. The foreign key must reference an existing primary key in another table, and it can have null values. A table can have multiple foreign keys, and each foreign key can reference the same primary key or a different primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that illustrates how primary keys and foreign keys are used in a database. Consider two tables, \"employees\" and \"departments\". The \"employees\" table contains information about the employees in a company, while the \"departments\" table contains information about the departments in the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"employees\" table might have columns like \"id\", \"name\", \"salary\", and \"department_id\". The \"id\" column could be the primary key for the \"employees\" table, while the \"department_id\" column could be a foreign key that refers to the \"id\" column in the \"departments\" table. The \"departments\" table might have columns like \"id\" and \"name\", with \"id\" being the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a foreign key in the \"employees\" table that references the \"id\" column in the \"departments\" table, we can establish a relationship between the two tables. This relationship can be used to ensure that all employees are assigned to a valid department and to perform queries that join the two tables based on the department id.\n",
    "\n",
    " A primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table, while a foreign key is a column or set of columns that refers to the primary key of another table. These two constraints are used to establish relationships between tables in a relational database and to enforce data integrity and referential integrity."
